# JS-24-Bit-CPU
24 bit CPU in JS has a really bad C compiler.
There is no name for the Afermentioned CPU and subsequent development kit. 
If you have any suggestions put them in the issues tab.

This CPU is a simpiler version of the 6502. I emulated most of the movement as MicroCode except for the ALU.

JavaScript was never meant to handle this so your browser might crash.
